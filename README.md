= What is this?

Hello,

I currently have a fairly large DJ library, which is mainly managed using Lexicon DJ. Unfortunately, I have quite a few duplicate playlists that I would like to delete. Hence, this project.

Hereâ€™s how to get it up and running:

    Download Lexicon DJ.

    Create some random folders and playlists, preferably with duplicates.

    Enable the Lexicon DJ API (it runs without authentication).

    Install the CORS Everywhere extension:
        CORS Everywhere for Firefox
        CORS Everywhere for Chrome

    Open cleanup.html, preferably in Firefox Developer Edition or a similar browser.
